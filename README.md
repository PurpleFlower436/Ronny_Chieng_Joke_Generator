# Ronny_Chieng_Joke_Generator


This is a project where I used Python to fine tune a babbage OpenAI model so it can create custom jokes from a headline that the user inputs. The jokes will be in Ronny Chieng's comedic style. 
The jokes_generator (1).ipynb file has the code that I used to fine tune the model.
